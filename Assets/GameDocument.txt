Patrol Guard
Done:
Patrolling route is on the last position and the current position of the guard after losing sight of the player
Improve:
* Can set rally points on the map for patrol and find the nearest points after chasing
* Thinking of using AI to find the best distribution for best defense but not sure what data to feed the AI and also time constraint
Chasing Player
Done:
Chase after detection, configuration of Distance and Angle of detection is available in the inspector. Light will be red when detected, white otherwise
Improve:
* Currently still able to walk outside the map
* Can have a shader for better vision lighting effects
Sound Detection
Done:
Alarm is to alert nearby guards - simple colliders are used to detect if player triggered the alarm and to inform guards around
Improve:
* Can add more detection such as hand triggered alarm, throwing things to make noise
Overall
Improve:
* Can add more obstacle, better GameOver UI and better game mechanics for example, collect coins or survive longer
